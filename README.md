### Implementation of a Software Defined Perimeter in Ryu SDN Framework
In order to access a service inside a network, clients must authenticate themselves by sending an authentication request to the network controller.
The authentication is based on a Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) computed using a pre-shared key. Sequential nonces are used in authentication requests to avoid replication.
